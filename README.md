db-introspection-notebook
=========================

Toolkit of queries for examining SQL databases, in executable IPython Notebook format.
For the moment there is only one notebook, for PostgreSQL, but that may change (feel free
to submit patches!).

Requires [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html) 
[the IPython %%SQL magic](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipython-sql), and a Python database 
adapter for the database in question, like [psycopg2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2).

PostgreSQL sample data comes from [opensourceshakespeare](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/opensourceshakespeare).
